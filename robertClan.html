<h1>Mr Robert Lee Brown</h1>
<h3><center>First Born Son</center></h3>
<p>Tangling interiorly with mental pictures of birth of our
    first born son, his brilliance and gentleness sweeping
    over me again and again.
    Absolute trust and love as he saw me for the first time,
    outside the womb.
    Beauty unsurpassed by anything or anyone as I looked
    lovingly at my precious baby boy.
    Gently holding him in my arms, kissing his forehead and
    little cheeks as he turned towards my touch and voice.
    Nothing on earth can ever compare with seeing your baby
    for the very first time.
    Something within, subtly changes and you are never the
    same again as you realize the miracle God has wrought
    in your life.
